# Accurate and Efficient Monitoring for Virtualized SDN in Clouds

This repository includes "V-Sight," a framework for network monitoring in virtualized SDN.
The framework is introduced in the following papers.

- Yang, Gyeongsik, et al. "Network Monitoring for SDN Virtual Networks." IEEE INFOCOM 2020-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE, 2020. [[Paper]](http://gsyang33.github.io/assets/papers/vsight-accepted-version.pdf)
- Yang, Gyeongsik, et al. "Accurate and Efficient Monitoring for Virtualized SDN in Clouds." IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing. IEEE, 2021 (Accepted).

**Note**
- The development of V-Sight is based on open-source network hypervisor, Libera (https://github.com/os-libera/Libera).
- The implementation of this project is tested internally, so it may not be able to apply in other infrastructures directly.
